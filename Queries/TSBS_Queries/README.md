This folder contains the 4 kinds of queries we used from TSBS, in order to compare the performance of the two databases  
for query batches. We normally executed batches of 100 queries each time from each of the 4 categories mentioned here.  
More information can be found in our report about how we dealt with query batches. Here, we only present the form of the  
4 query types.
